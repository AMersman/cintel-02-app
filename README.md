## Shiny For Python

With the advent of WASM (Web Assembly), it is now possible to run Python in the browser.
We can write the logic for our interactive apps using Python instead of JavaScript.

Shiny is the most popular interactive web app framework for R (another popular data science language) and recently became available for Python. 

To get started, read [SHINY.md](SHINY.md).
